This Kapost plug-in is a companion with the instance that you can create at Kapost.com.

== Description ==
This plugin allows posts published from Kapost.com into your WordPress blog to keep the same username for the author. If the author on the published post doesn't exist in WordPress (check done by looking at email address), this plugin will create a new user in WordPress.

In addition, this plugin allows Kapost instances to publish to a Custom Type.
